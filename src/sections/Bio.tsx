            <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed">
                I'm Godwin Adakonye John, a creative full-stack developer from Nigeria with a burning desire to transform challenges into impactful digital experiences. My passion for tech goes beyond writing code — it's about solving real-life problems with creativity and empathy.
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed">
                Over the years, I’ve explored multiple technologies like React, Node.js, PHP, MySQL, Rust, and Solana. Whether it's building web apps, APIs, or interactive frontends, I believe in clean code, scalable architecture, and intuitive design. I also have a strong eye for UI/UX and love turning sketches into smooth user flows.
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed">
                When I'm not coding, I enjoy mentoring junior devs, tinkering with open-source, or studying how blockchain and AI are shaping the future. This portfolio reflects my story — not just as a developer, but as a tech adventurer chasing growth every day.
